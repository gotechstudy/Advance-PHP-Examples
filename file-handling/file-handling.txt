- File handling is a very important part in web application. It means, we can add, read, edit files programmatically. Many of the built-in functions helps for these works.
	Example: save contact form data in txt file, store application errors in log file etc.

- Built-in function
	=> fopen(): fopen(file_name, file_mode)
	=> fread(): fread(file_pointer, file_length_bytes)
	=> fwrite(): fwrite(file_pointer, data_to_write)
	=> fclose(): fclose(file_pointer)
	=> file_get_contents(): file_get_contents(file_name_with_path)

- File Modes:
	r => Read Only
	w => Write only
	a => Append only
	x => Create & write
	r+ => Read & Write
	w+ => Write & Read
